## SYST10199 Web Programming - All Assignments (4)
Program: **Computer Programming @ Sheridan College** <br>
Note: The following assignments were completed during Semester 2 (2024) <br>
Language(s): HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## The Details: 
The contents of the public_html folder compiled all assignments. 

Assignment 1: <br>
Create a homepage that introduces the company. It should at least contain two images and a company logo. 

Assignment 2: <br>
Create a product page that showcases at least 4 products. The images are to appear beside each other. If the user clicks on an image, a prompt of purchase should pop up. Below each image is the price and a *More Info* tagline, the description is shown when hovered. The quantity for each product is displayed only when the user places an order. 

Assignment 3: <br>
Create a form page that obtains shipment information for the products ordered in Assignment 2. The summary section should display products ordered, contact information and payment details. Must have a submit button and a reset button. 

Assignment 4: <br>
Standalone. For this assignment, students are to use JavaScript objects to keep track of multiple separate orders. The index.html page will allow the creation of multiple orders. Each order confirmed will be saved as a JavaScript object that is then added to an orderList (an array of objects). Once all orders have been completed, the orderList will be sent to another web page found in another folder. The second web page will display all orders in a table, with headings such as Customer Name, Customer Address, Product 1, Product 2, Product 3, etc.

## Thoughts/Comments: 
I would say that my HTML and CSS improved compared to the first semester. I was more mindful about using the proper semantic tags. Learning JavaScript was an amazing experience given how my professor provided organized notes/materials. Hoping to create games using JavaScript in the future.
